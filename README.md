How I set up my home lab 
(OK, this write-up is still a work in progress!)

## Network Setup

My home network is set up with an Orbi mesh wifi system (an Orbi router and 2 satellites). The current hardware is RBR50 and RBS50. 

Initially, our home system included one router and one satellite, but I wanted a second satellite in the home office so I could isolate a network to use for my home lab. After pricing out an RBS50 satellite (and realizing they are hard to come by and fairly expensive), I  purchased the new Orbi WiFi 6 (RBR750/RBS750) system with 2 satellites, and I had high hopes for it. However, when I set it up it caused so many problems with our home network that after giving it a good try for about a week I returned it to Costco and re-installed the old hardware. I searched for a used RBS50 satellite on eBay and found one for a decent price--and I've been very happy with it.

Attached to a port on the Orbi satellite in my office I have a Netgear managed switch. I hope to set up a VLAN using the managed switch, **_more details to come_**.
